An 'as simple as it gets' WebRTC example.

See LINK for a detailed walkthrough of the code.

### Usage

The signaling server uses Node.js and `ws` and can be started as such:

```
$ npm install ws
$ node server/server.js
```

With the client running, open `client/index.html` in a recent version of either Firefox or Chrome.
